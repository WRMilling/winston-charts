# Authelia Chart

Copied from [https://github.com/authelia/chartrepo/](https://github.com/authelia/chartrepo/) for testing purposes. 

**NOTICE:** This chart is currently a beta. Until it reaches version 1.0.0 it may have regular breaking changes. It is
not recommended at this stage for production environments without manual intervention to check the templated manifests
match your desired state.

# Getting Started

Visit https://charts.authelia.com and follow the instructions to install the chart repo.

A more in depth guide is coming. Some key points below.

The chart values.yaml is configured by default for production environments. It expects you will configure the following
sections:

- domain (this is essential for the chart to work)
- configMap (the configMap follows a majority of the configuration options
  in [the documentation](https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration))
- secret section to setup passwords and other secret information, configuring this directly is not supported
